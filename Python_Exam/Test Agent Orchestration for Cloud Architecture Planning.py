# Agent Orchestration for Cloud Architecture Planning
# Format: Problem statement + Written response

"""
AGENT ORCHESTRATION CHALLENGE

You need to design a multi-agent system that can analyze business problems and recommend 
cloud architecture solutions. Focus on the orchestration strategy, not implementation details.

SAMPLE SCENARIOS (choose 2 to address):

1. "Simple E-commerce Site"
   - Online store for small business (1000 daily users)
   - Product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing
   - Basic admin dashboard for inventory management

2. "Customer Support Chatbot"
   - AI chatbot for customer service 
   - Integration with existing CRM system
   - Handle 500+ conversations per day
   - Escalate complex issues to human agents

3. "Employee Expense Tracker"
   - Mobile app for expense reporting
   - Receipt photo upload and processing
   - Approval workflow for managers
   - Integration with payroll system

YOUR TASK:
Design an agent orchestration approach that can take these problems and output 
a cloud architecture recommendation including basic services needed (database, 
API gateway, compute, storage, etc.).
"""

# Your Code Here

"""
agent_orchestration_cloud_planner.py

A runnable simulation of a multi-agent orchestration system that:
- Accepts a scenario/problem statement
- Agents extract requirements, map to cloud resources, estimate cost & compliance,
  validate integrations, and produce a final recommended architecture.

This is a simulation â€” no external network calls or secrets are used.
The code is modular so you can replace internal heuristics with real models/APIs.

# === WRITTEN RESPONSE QUESTIONS ===

"""
QUESTION 1: AGENT DESIGN (20 points)
What agents would you create for this orchestration? Describe:
- 3-5 specific agents and their roles
- How they would collaborate on the sample problems
- What each agent's input and output would be

Example format:
Agent Name: Requirements Analyst
Role: Break down business requirements into technical needs
Input: Problem description + business context
Output: List of functional requirements, expected load, compliance needs

QUESTION 2: ORCHESTRATION WORKFLOW (25 points)
For ONE of the sample scenarios, walk through your complete workflow:
- Step-by-step process from problem statement to final recommendation
- How agents hand off information to each other
- What happens if an agent fails or produces unclear output
- How you ensure the final solution is complete and feasible

QUESTION 3: CLOUD RESOURCE MAPPING (20 points)
For your chosen scenario, what basic cloud services would your system recommend?
- Compute (serverless functions, containers, VMs)
- Storage (databases, file storage, caching)
- Networking (API gateways, load balancers, CDN)
- Security and monitoring basics
- Justify why each service fits the requirements

QUESTION 4: REUSABILITY & IMPROVEMENT (15 points)
How would you make this system work across different projects?
- What would you standardize vs. customize per project?
- How would the system learn from previous recommendations?
- What feedback mechanisms would improve future solutions?

QUESTION 5: PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS (20 points)
What challenges would you expect and how would you handle:
- Conflicting recommendations between agents
- Incomplete or vague problem statements
- Budget constraints not mentioned in requirements
- Integration with existing legacy systems
- Keeping up with new cloud services and pricing
